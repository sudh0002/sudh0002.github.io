# Domino's

## Introduction
That's Domino's... as in pizza!

## Objective
Use the JavaScript skills you have learned to add functionality to the Create Your Own Pizza web application.

## Requirements

1. Download the [Domino's Starter Files](https://github.com/MTM6230/dominos/archive/master.zip). The starter files contain an `index.html` file, a `style.css` file, an `index.js` file, and an `images` folder. **All changes for this assignment will be made to the `index.js` file.**
2. When the sizes select box is changed: add the functionality that will update the pizza's sizes text that corresponds to the size selected.
3. When a topping button is clicked: add the functionality that will toggle the class `checked` on the button clicked. 
4. When a topping button is clicked: add the functionality that will toggle the class `show` on the corresponding pizza topping.
5. Submit the `index.js` file to the **Domino's** assignment on Brightspace.
